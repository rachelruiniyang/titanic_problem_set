## Aggregate train and test data

def combine_train_test(train_df, test_df, target_col):

    Combine the train and test DataFrames, and label the rows based on the dataset they belong to.

    Parameters:
    train_df (pd.DataFrame): The training DataFrame.
    test_df (pd.DataFrame): The testing DataFrame.
    target_col (str): The target column that indicates the training label (e.g., 'Survived').

    Returns:
    pd.DataFrame: A DataFrame combining both train and test data, with an additional 'set' column.
